## Processing multiple files

In our previous lesson, we parsed values from output files.  While you might have seen the utility of doing such a thing, you might have also wondered why we didn't just search the file and cut and paste the values we wanted into a spreadsheet.  If you only have 1 or 2 files, this might be a very reasonable thing to do.  But what if you had 100 files to analyze?  What if you had 1000?  In such a case the cutting and pasting method would be very tedious and time consuming.  

One of the real powers of writing a program to analyze your data is that you can just as easily analyze 100 files as 1 file.
